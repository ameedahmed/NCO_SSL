# LEHD Model Research (2023â€“2024)

This repository contains all files related to a research project conducted in collaboration with **University of Hildesheim** (2023â€“2024).  
The project explores various strategies to improve solution quality and training performance of the **LEHD (Learning to Extract and Heuristically Decode)** model for combinatorial optimization problems.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository consists of **6 main folders**, each focusing on a distinct experimental setup or training strategy:

1. **Random Reconstruction (Control Experiment)**  
   - Contains files where the **initial solution is generated randomly** instead of using the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic.  
   - Goal: Measure the impact of NN-based initialization on the final model performance.

2. **Skewed Distribution + Linear Learning Rate**  
   - Implements a **skewed distribution of problem sizes** combined with a **linear learning rate schedule**.  
   - Purpose: Prevent oversampling of small problem sizes in each epoch.

3. **Curriculum Learning (Sigmoidal + Linear Scheduler)**  
   - Contains files modified to integrate **Curriculum Learning** with:
     - **Sigmoidal learning rate scheduler**  
     - **Linear problem-size growth schedule**  
   - Objective: Gradually increase problem size difficulty to improve model generalization.

4. **Beam Search Heuristic Replacement**  
   - Experiments with replacing the **greedy heuristic** in LEHD with a **Beam Search heuristic** during the solution reconstruction phase.  
   - Aim: Improve the quality of reconstructed solutions.

5. **Random Reconstruction with Partial Solution Replacement**  
   - NN trained decoder breaks the solution into smaller pieces and **randomly reconstructs parts of it**, replacing sub-solutions created by NN with better candidates, during the training process.  
   - Objective: Remove model dependency on costly training labels generated by complex solvers.

6. **Vanilla Training**  
   - Contains files for the **baseline (vanilla) training strategy** of the LEHD model.  
   - Serves as a reference point for comparing other experimental setups.

## ðŸ§ª Research Objective

The overarching goal of these experiments is to:
- Remove dependency on costly training labels generated by complex solvers
- Study the **impact of initialization strategies** on solution quality  
- Evaluate **curriculum learning approaches** for better convergence  
- Explore **heuristic modifications** (e.g., Beam Search) to improve solution reconstruction
